# Plugin responsible for authenticating owners against NickServ.
# Plugins that perform administrative functions may use this to 
# validate bot owners. A nick must be in the owners array in the
# config file and be identified (STATUS == 3) to be recognized.
# Note: this is not a "classic" plugin, in that it is meant to be
# included and used by way of its exports.authorize method.

# TODO: I'd like to cache the response, but it would be
# risky without somehow watching for the user to disconnect
# and resetting the authorization, or some such. Too much
# trouble for the moment.
